A plugin to create and manage events, developed by Joana Ray.

== Description ==

Ray Events is a very simple plugin to create and manage events.
It creates a custom post type with custom fields for the event's location, date and organiser.
It also includes a shortcode that renders a grid with the upcoming events.

= Features: =
* **Custom post type Events** - A new type of page, easier to find and manage your event related content.
* **Event template** - If you have a classic theme installed, the single event page will render the event date, location and organiser.
* **[upcoming_events] shorcode** - There's a shortcode [upcoming_events] which will display a 3 column grid with the upcoming events. By default it renders the next 3 upcoming events and it can be customised with the parameter "display" to limit or increase the amount of events shown. [upcoming_events display=6] will show the next 6 upcoming events.
[upcoming_events display=-1] will show all the upcoming events.
